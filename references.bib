While kernel security relies fundamentally on preventing access to address information, recent attacks have shown that the hardware directly leaks this information. Strictly splitting kernel space and user space has recently been proposed as a theoretical concept to close these side channels. However, this is not trivially possible due to architectural restrictions of the x86 platform.",

  abstract = {Abstract Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are among the most widespread of security problems. Numerous incidents of buffer overflow attacks have been reported and many solutions have been proposed, but a solution that is both complete and highly practical is yet to be found. Another kind of vulnerability called format string overflow has recently been found and although not as widespread as buffer overflow, format string overflow attacks are no less dangerous. This article surveys representative techniques of exploiting buffer overflow and format string overflow vulnerabilities and their currently available defensive measures. We also describe our buffer overflow detection technique that range checks the referenced buffers at run-time. We augment executable files with the type information of automatic buffers (local variables and parameters of functions) and static buffers (global variables in the data/bss section) and maintain the sizes of allocated heap buffers in order to detect an actual occurrence of buffer overflow. We describe a simple implementation with which we currently protect vulnerable copy functions in the C library. Copyright Â© 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This allows use of optimization techniques that are most easily applied to directly recursive procedures, in addition to the well-known benefits of inlining. We present tight (necessary and sufficient) conditions under which inlining can transform all mutual recursion to direct recursion, and those under which heuristics to eliminate mutual recursion always terminate. We also present a technique to eliminate mutually recursive circuits that consist of only tail calls. From this, we conclude that tail recursion elimination should be interleaved with inlining.},

Given the host of security measures on modern machines, are we less vulnerable than before, and can we expect to eradicate memory error problems in the near future? In this paper, we present a quarter century worth of memory errors: attacks, defenses, and statistics. A historical overview provides insights in past trends and developments, while an investigation of real-world vulnerabilities and exploits allows us to answer on the significance of memory errors in the foreseeable future.",

It provides its users with a collection of plug-ins that perform static analysis, deductive verification, and testing, for safety- and security-critical software. Collaborative verification across cooperating plug-ins is enabled by their integration on top of a shared kernel and datastructures, and their compliance to a common specification language. This foundational article presents a consolidated view of the platform, its main and composite analyses, and some of its industrial achievements.",

  ABSTRACT = {Systems that are built using low-power computationally-weak devices, which force developers to favor performance over security; which jointly with its high connectivity, continuous and autonomous operation makes those devices specially appealing to attackers. ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) is one of the most effective mitigation techniques against remote code execution attacks, but when it is implemented in a practical system its effectiveness is jeopardized by multiple constraints: the size of the virtual memory space, the potential fragmentation problems, compatibility limitations, etc. As a result, most ASLR implementations (specially in 32-bits) fail to provide the necessary protection. In this paper we propose a taxonomy of all ASLR elements, which categorizes the entropy in three dimensions: (1) how, (2) when and (3) what; and includes novel forms of entropy. Based on this taxonomy we have created, ASLRA, an advanced statistical analysis tool to assess the effectiveness of any ASLR implementation. Our analysis show that all ASLR implementations suffer from several weaknesses, 32-bit systems provide a poor ASLR, and OS X has a broken ASLR in both 32- and 64-bit systems. This is jeopardizing not only servers and end users devices as smartphones but also the whole IoT ecosystem. To overcome all these issues, we present ASLR-NG, a novel ASLR that provides the maximum possible absolute entropy and removes all correlation attacks making ASLR-NG the best solution for both 32- and 64-bit systems. We implemented ASLR-NG in the Linux kernel 4.15. The comparative evaluation shows that ASLR-NG overcomes PaX, Linux and OS X implementations, providing strong protection to prevent attackers from abusing weak ASLRs.},
